# hackweek-svg-project

- Vue
- Bootstrap - yarn add bootstrap
- Greensock - yarn add gsap

## What went well

- Was able to get libraries hooked up and functional
- Learned more about SVG workflow from Illustrator
- Combined multiple SVGs in the same component

## What didn't go well

- Had some other outside tasks pop up
- Got hung up on element selection for a while
- Couldn't figure out looping through and staggering individual element animations

# What would I do next?

- Get a better handle on starting positions and using the appropriate method (to, from, fromTo)
- Figure out how to control center points or origins in elements
- Have animations loop (timelines) and reset like I want.
